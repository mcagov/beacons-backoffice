# beacons-backoffice

The Beacons Backoffice single page application (SPA) is now built and served from within the 
[Beacons Service](https://github.com/mcagov/beacons-service).

This repository provides a simple redirect page at `public/index.html` to the Beacons Service for users with the old URL.

## Why?

See [the ADR](https://github.com/mcagov/beacons-integration/blob/main/docs/adr/0007-2021-10-25-serve-backoffice-spa-from-spring.md).
